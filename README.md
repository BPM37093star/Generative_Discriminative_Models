Practical: Na誰ve Bayes vs Logistic Regression
This practical task is based on the paper:

On Discriminative vs. Generative classifiers: A comparison of logistic regression and naive Bayes
Andrew Y. Ng & Michael I. Jordan, NIPS 2001
Link to paper

Goals
Implement a Na誰ve Bayes Classifier from scratch with NumPy to handle binary and continuous data.

Use Pandas to preprocess and analyze datasets.

Reproduce experiments comparing Na誰ve Bayes and Logistic Regression on given datasets.

(Optional) Extend Na誰ve Bayes to handle categorical data for bonus points.

Datasets
binary_test.csv

categorical_test.csv

voting.csv

breast-cancer.csv

Instructions
Read the Introduction and Experiments sections of the paper.

Follow provided notebooks for data handling and preparation.

Compare results and analyze differences between classifiers.

Outcome
Understand differences between generative and discriminative models, and gain practical skills in implementing classic ML algorithms.
