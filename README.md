# Practical: Na誰ve Bayes vs Logistic Regression

This practical task is based on the paper:

**On Discriminative vs. Generative classifiers: A comparison of logistic regression and naive Bayes**  
*Andrew Y. Ng & Michael I. Jordan, NIPS 2001*

## Goals

- Implement a **Na誰ve Bayes Classifier** from scratch using **NumPy**, supporting binary and continuous data.  
- Use **Pandas** for data preprocessing and analysis.  
- Reproduce experiments comparing Na誰ve Bayes and Logistic Regression on the provided datasets.  
- *(Optional)* Extend Na誰ve Bayes to handle categorical data for bonus points.

## Datasets

- `binary_test.csv`  
- `categorical_test.csv`  
- `voting.csv`  
- `breast-cancer.csv`

---

## Instructions

1. Read the **Introduction** and **Experiments** sections of the paper.  
2. Use provided notebooks for data handling and preparation.  
3. Implement the classifiers and run experiments.  
4. Analyze and compare the results.

## Outcome

Gain hands-on experience with generative and discriminative classifiers, data preprocessing, and machine learning implementation from scratch.
